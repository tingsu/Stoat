# Stoat Prototype
Stoat (STochastic model App Tester) is a guided approach to perform stochastic model-based testing on Android Apps. The idea is to thoroughly test the functionalities of an app from its GUI model, and validate the app’s behavior by enforcing various user/system interactions. 

*You can find more about our work on testing/analyzing Android apps at this [website](https://tingsu.github.io/files/mobile-app-analysis.html)*.

# Update

We have made all the Stoat's source code publicly available. We hope this project can benefit other researchers or practiontiners in the field of automated GUI testing of Android apps. Feel free to contact us if you have any questions and issues. We will continue to maintain this project. Thanks for your feedback.

Next step: We will integrate Jacoco with Stoat to handle gradle-based Android projects.

# Quick Review

Click this [link](https://tingsu.github.io/files/stoat.html) for quick review on the approach workflow, evaluation results, demo and etc.

# Setup 

You can checkout Stoat from this repo.

### Environment Configration
* Ruby: 2.1 

* [Nokogiri](http://www.nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html)

If your default ruby version is lower than 2.1, the installation of Nokogiri will fail. In this case, please [upgrade ruby to 2.1 or higher](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26595620/how-to-install-ruby-2-1-4-on-ubuntu-14-04). If the installation still fails due to [this issue](https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/133), you need to execute "sudo apt-get install ruby2.1-dev".

* Python: 2.7

* Android SDK: API 18+ 

Android SDK recently makes an update about emulators. If you cannot start the emulator (like "Cannot launch AVD in emulator:QT library not found"), please check [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42554337/cannot-launch-avd-in-emulatorqt-library-not-found) for solution. You can create an emulator before running Stoat. See [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43275238/how-to-set-system-images-path-when-creating-an-android-avd) for how to create avd using [avdmanager](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/avdmanager).

E.g. 

1. sdkmanager  "system-images;android-18;google_apis;x86"

2. avdmanager create avd --force --name testAVD_1 --package 'system-images;android-18;google_apis;x86' --abi google_apis/x86 --sdcard 512M --device 'Nexus 7'

* Ubuntu 14.04/Linux

* uiautomator (A python wrapper of [UIAutomator](https://github.com/xiaocong/uiautomator))


We strongly recommend to run Stoat on a physical machine to ensure the performance instead of ruuning on virtual machines (e.g., VirtualBox or Docker). In addition, please choose x86 image if you use Android emulators, and [setup hardware acceleration](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration.html) for [Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Installation).

Please export ANDROID_HOME (for android sdk), PYTHON_PATH (for uiautomator), CLASSPATH (for soot)

 Example:
  ```
  export ANDROID_HOME="/home/XX/Android/Sdk"
  export PYTHONPATH="/home/XX/uiautomator"
  export CLASSPATH="/home/XX/fsmdroid/soot-github/lib/soot-develop.jar
  export PATH=$PATH:${ANDROID_HOME}/build-tools/25.0.0:${ANDROID_HOME}/emulator:${ANDROID_HOME}/tools:${ANDROID_HOME}/tools/bin:${ANDROID_HOME}/platform-tools:
  ```
You may also need to modify "Stoat/CONF.txt" to set the tool path.
  
# Usage

Stoat provides several ways to test android apps by command lines. Note before running Stoat, please disable keyboard (for emulator, add "hw.keyboard=yes" in its config.ini; for real device, please install the "com.wparam.nullkeyboard_1.apk" at "Stoat/bin/sdcard", and configure it to be the default input method)
Please also add "hw.mainKeys=yes" in the config.ini to disable the soft "main" keys if you use emulators, which may affect Stoat's exploration.

1. Ant opens-soruce projects

 	ruby run_stoat_testing.rb --app_dir /home/XX/caldwell.ben.bites_4_src --avd_name testAVD_1 --avd_port 5554 --stoat_port 2000 --project_type ant 
 	
2. apk without instrumentation

	**Note this may mitigate Stoat's power due to lack of coverage info for test optimization. Otherwise, you need to instrument apk with Ella**
    
	ruby run_stoat_testing.rb --app_dir /home/XX/Bites.apk --avd_name testAVD_1 --avd_port 5554 --stoat_port 2000 (the output will be under "/home/XX/Bites-output")
 	 
3. Use real device, ant projects

	Please open wifi, and disable keyboard before do testing on real device.
    
 	ruby run_stoat_testing.rb --app_dir /home/XX/caldwell.ben.bites_4_src/ --real_device_serial cf00b9e6 --stoat_port 2000 --project_type ant 
	
4. A list of apps (If they are apks, append the option "--project_type apk")

	ruby run_stoat_testing.rb **--apps_dir** /home/XX/test_apps/ --apps_list /home/XX/test_apps/apps_list.txt --avd_name testAVD_1 --avd_port 5554 --stoat_port 2000 --force_restart 


### Subject Requirement:
* instrumented apps (use [Emma](http://emma.sourceforge.net/index.html) for open-source apps and [Ella](https://github.com/saswatanand/ella) for closed-source apps) should end with "-debug.apk"
* closed-source/non-instrumented apk can also be tested, and its name should end with ".apk"

## Benchmark

Some benchmark apps used in our paper.

##  Notes
* This implementation has been tested with Android 4.4, running on Ubuntu 14.04. 
* If measure statement coverage for open-sourced apps, the subjects need to be processed to support EMMA instrumentation:
(Please refer to [Dynodroid](https://code.google.com/archive/p/dyno-droid/) for details.) You can also refer to the apps in the benchmark.
* This version only supports testing ant projects.

## TODO
1. use monkey to bypass welcome page in google play apps

2. directly use monkey to start the app instead of using "am", the monkey way is more robust.
